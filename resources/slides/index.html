### how to not be a jerk...

# No feigning surprise

The first rule means you shouldn't act surprised when people say they don't
know something. This applies to both technical things ("What?! I can't believe
you don't know what the stack is!") and non-technical things ("You don't know
who RMS is?!"). Feigning surprise has absolutely no social or educational
benefit: When people feign surprise, it's usually to make them feel better
about themselves and others feel worse. And even when that's not the intention,
it's almost always the effect. As you've probably already guessed, this rule is
tightly coupled to our belief in the importance of people feeling comfortable
saying "I don't know" and "I don't understand."

# No well-actually's

A well-actually happens when someone says something that's almost - but not
entirely - correct, and you say, "well, actually…" and then give a minor
correction. This is especially annoying when the correction has no bearing on
the actual conversation. This doesn't mean we're not about
truth-seeking or that we don't care about being precise. Almost all
well-actually's in our experience are about grandstanding, not truth-seeking.
(Thanks to Miguel de Icaza for originally coining the term "well-actually.")

# No back-seat driving

If you overhear people working through a problem, you shouldn't intermittently
lob advice across the room. This can lead to the "too many cooks" problem, but
more important, it can be rude and disruptive to half-participate in a
conversation. This isn't to say you shouldn't help, offer advice, or join
conversations. On the contrary, we encourage all those things. Rather, it just
means that when you want to help out or work with others, you should fully
engage and not just butt in sporadically.

# No subtle -isms

Our last social rule bans subtle racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, and
other kinds of bias. This one is different from the rest, because it covers a
class of behaviors instead of one very specific pattern.

Subtle -isms are small things that make others feel uncomfortable, things that
we all sometimes do by mistake. For example, saying "It's so easy my
grandmother could do it" is a subtle -ism. Like the other three social rules,
this one is often accidentally broken. Like the other three, it's not a big
deal to mess up – you just apologize and move on.

# Let the learner drive

At times it may be faster when you're helping someone to jump on their keyboard
and just get the task done, but that's no way to learn. Although at times this
takes a great deal of patience for both parties, in the end, one of the best
ways to learn is by doing. So, unless someone offers their keys up, let them do
the driving.
